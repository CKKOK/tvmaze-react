# TVMaze-React

This repo contains a re-do of the [TVMaze-Angular exercise](https://github.com/CKKOK/tvmaze-angular), a simple front-end search interface for the TVMaze API as a Single Page Application with infinite scroll on results from an empty query. The exercise was originally done using React.

At this scale, it is likely that React offers a quicker time to live than Angular, and a better dev experience.
